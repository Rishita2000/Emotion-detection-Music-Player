# Emotion-detection-Music-Player
Created a music player app that uses facial recognition and machine learning to play music based on the user's mood and detect their emotion. The interface is made up of HTML, CSS, JS and Open CV. Implemented features such as playlists based on emotions, song recommendations, and user feedback for improved accuracy.
